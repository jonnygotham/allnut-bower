Configuration: Variables and Settings

This file contains the base variables and settings used for the different mixins
and functions in Allnut.

Note:
These variables and settings are universal and unchanging, and at times, used
for reference.  When Allnut is integrated into a project, some variables and
settings should be customized to fit that project, thus overriding the basic
implementation.
